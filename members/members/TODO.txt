- changed attrs are saved, even if sthg went wrong (i.e. no action passed to save-shift)
- could I pass msg and order_id to redir_to_wg, but not in the URL?
- do I still need 'fresh' IDs now that view and edit views are distinct?
- custom 404 view
- custom error view, how?
- slash at the end of URL: problem. look up solution in handbook
