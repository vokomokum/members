INSTALLATION


-- First, the dependencies:

You should have a modern python (2.6+) and postgres on your system.
To update the member app code, you also need subversion (svn).


-- To begin, we create a virtual python environment

(let's call it "vopy") with all needed libraries:
Go to the directory where your local Python environment should be (it
needs to be executable by the Apache user). In this tutorial, let's pretend that it goes in your
home dir (~).
$ cd
$ wget https://raw.github.com/pypa/virtualenv/master/virtualenv.py
Here, make sure you use the python you want. This just uses the first in your path:
$ python virtualenv.py vopy
Install some needed libraries
$ cd vopy/bin
$ ./pip install pyramid  # web framework + dependencies
$ ./pip install psycopg2 # Postgres wrapper for Python
$ cd ../..
$ rm virtualenv.py

-- Check out the member app code (if you don't have it already)

$ cd <location where you want vokomokum code to go>
$ svn co TODO


-- Develop the app (this also installs all needed python libs locally)
$ cd vokomokum/trunk/members
$ ~/vopy/bin/python setup.py develop


-- Set which database to use in the .ini file(s)

Here is a typical line from development.ini:
<<<
sqlalchemy.url = postgresql+psycopg2://user:passwd@localhost:5432/vokotest
>>>
where vokotest is the database, and user and passwd have to be set by you.
It seems reasonable that development.ini uses a different database than production.ini


-- See if the App is served through its own server (if you can access localhost, e.g. on your home PC)

$ ./run 
The Member application should now respond under http://localhost:6543.
(the run script loads development.ini by default, you can change that for testing)
Do a CTRL-C to stop it, we want Apache to run it (via mod_wsgi).


-- Install the apache mod_wsgi module

1. Download the latest mod_wsgiX.X.tar.gz from http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi (currently: X.X=3.3)
You can do this in your home dir
$ cd
$ wget http://modwsgi.googlecode.com/files/mod_wsgi-3.3.tar.gz
Untar it to some place, then cd into that dir 
$ tar -zxf mod_wsgi-3.3.tar.gz
$ cd mod_wsgi-3.3
$ ./configure --with-python=~/vopy/bin/python
$ make
$ sudo make install
(you can remove the downloaded file/directory later, once mod_wsgi has been installed in Apache)

2. Now make sure that Apache knows about mod_wsgi - add the following line to /etc/apache2/httpd.conf:
LoadModule wsgi_module modules/mod_wsgi.so
Or, on OSX 10.6:
LoadModule wsgi_module libexec/apache2/mod_wsgi.so

3. Restart the Apache server
$ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
Or, on OSX 10.6:
$ sudo /usr/sbin/apachectl restart
In /var/log/apache2/error_log, there should be a mention of mod_wsgi being reconfigured like this:
[Mon Jan 02 00:06:56 2012] [notice] Apache/2.2.20 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.20
OpenSSL/0.9.8r DAV/2 mod_wsgi/3.3 Python/2.7.1 configured -- resuming normal operations

See also: http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/QuickInstallationGuide


-- Do some Apache configuration (this is for Apache2 on OSX, might be different on other Unix systems?)

1. In the directory where your Apache looks for config files (e.g. /etc/apache2/vhosts.d or /etc/apache2/other), place a file with this content:
<<<
WSGIPythonHome /home/nic/vopy

NameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1
<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1>
    ServerName members.localhost

    <Directory />
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

    WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
    WSGIDaemonProcess pyramid.dev display-name=%{GROUP} 
    #   user=nic group=staff \ 
    #   python-path=/home/nic/vopy/lib/python2.7/site-packages
    WSGIProcessGroup pyramid.dev
    WSGIScriptAlias / /home/nic/Documents/vokomokum/members/pyramid.wsgi
</VirtualHost>
>>>
Replace WSGIPythonHome with the path to the virtual python environment we made earlier, ServerName with the URL you want the app to be reachable, and 127.0.0.1 with *:80 if you are on a web server. Also adapt the path the pyramid.wsgi script
Hint 1: In pyramid.wsgi, 'production.ini' can be replaced by 'development.ini' for easier debugging and such niceties. this is useful if you are running a test or developing version.
Hint 2: You can look for documentation on mod_wsgi directives here: http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ConfigurationDirectives

2. You also need to make the URL on which the app should be reachable known to the server.
On my local machine, I want to reach it at 'members.localhost', so I add a line to /etc/hosts (in this case: "127.0.0.1      members.localhost"
On a web server, you might need to add a DNS entry (most likely via your webhosters administration)

3. Now restart the Apache server
$ sudo /usr/sbin/apachectl restart
