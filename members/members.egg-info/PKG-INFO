        INSTALLATION
        
        # -- First, we create a virtual python environment
        # (let's call it "vopy") with all needed libraries:
        # You should have a modern python (2.6+) and postgres on your system.
        
        # go to your home dir
        $ cd
        # install virtual environment (in ~/vopy)
        $ wget https://raw.github.com/pypa/virtualenv/master/virtualenv.py
        $ python virtual-python.py vopy
        # install some needed libraries
        $ cd vopy/bin
        $ ./pip install pyramid  # web framework + dependencies
        $ ./pip install psycopg2 # Postgres wrapper for Python
        
        # install subversion if needed
        TODO
        
        # -- check out member app
        $ cd <location of member app>
        $ svn co TODO
        
        # -- develop app
        $ TODO: do this in home dir 
        $ TILDE/vopy/bin/python setup.py develop
        
        # -- see if the App is served on its own server
        $ cd <location of member app>
        $ ./run 
        # The Member application should now respond under http://localhost:6543
        # do a CTRL-C to stop it, we want Apache to run it
        
        # -- install mod_wsgi
        # download the latest mod_wsgiX.X.tar.gz from http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi
        # untar it to some place, then cd into that dir 
        ./configure --with-python=/Users/nic/vopy/bin/python
        make
        sudo make install
        # (you can remove the downloaded file/directory later, once mod_wsgi has been installed in Apache)
        # Now mkae sure that Apache knows about mod_wsgi:
        # Add to /etc/apache2/httpd.conf:
        LoadModule wsgi_module libexec/apache2/mod_wsgi.so
        # restart the Apache server
        sudo /usr/sbin/apachectl restart
        # in /var/log/apache2/error_log, there should be a mention of mod_wsgi being reconfigured like this:
        # [Mon Jan 02 00:06:56 2012] [notice] Apache/2.2.20 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.20 OpenSSL/0.9.8r DAV/2 mod_wsgi/3.3 Python/2.7.1 configured -- resumin normal operations
        
        
        # -- do some Apache configuration (this is for apache 2 on OSX, might be different on other Unix systems?)
        # in /etc/apache2/other, place the file modwsgi.conf (see members/modwsgi dir)
        # in <path-to-member-app>/modwsgi, place file called pyramid.wsgi, with contents:
        <<<
        from pyramid.paster import get_app
        application = get_app(
            '<path-to-member-app>/production.ini', 'main')
        >>>
        # production.ini can be replaced by development.ini for easier debugging and such niceties
        
        # -- restart the Apache server
        sudo /usr/sbin/apachectl restart
