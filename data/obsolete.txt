The following data fields are not in use anymore.
We could drop them (but would have to look out for any code depending on them).
We might just hide their usage in the order app for now, but it is good to keep track.
If further investigation would be needed before dropping, this in indicated by "(?)".

- mem_order.amnt (amount field that does not seem to be correct nor used anywhere)
- (?) mem_order.completed (and other date fields, seem identical to the ones in wh_order)
- members.membership_paid (will soon be modeled by transactions: members are charged 10 Euros per household member)
