To remove a product (because it's no longer sold), simply delete the row
If you want to keep the product, but not offer it for sale, don't remove the row, use the Edit Product page.
To add a new product, create a new row, set the product code to zero. The actual product code will be chosen by the database.
All products must have all the cells in their row filled out. You can always copy from another row, then edit the description of URL to create new product.
