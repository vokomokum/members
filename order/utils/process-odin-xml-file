Assuming the Odin XML file has been attached to an email to systems@vokomokum.nl:

1) save the attachment on your own PC

2) You need to have a copy of Ruby and its libraries installed (most Linux distributions will have
it or something like apt-get install ruby or yum -y install ruby should take care of it. I don't
know what's needed with windows

3) I believe the Odin file is ataached as a .zip file, in which case you need to unzip it. For
example, assuming you saved the attachment in /tmp

   cd /tmp
   # unzip the file, you'll get a new output file with the extension .xml
   # note that the spaces in the name mean you'll want quotes around the full file name
   unzip '1039 producten 20191114.zip'
   # now run the conversion script on the unzipped result
   ruby convert_odi_xml_to_csv_tb '1039 producten 20191114.xml'
   # after about 5 minutes, the script completes and the results will be in the file 'prods.csv'
   # this needs to be uploaded to the site as a .zip file, so first zip prods.csv into prods.zip
   zip prods prods.csv
   # now use your web brwoser to go the vokomokum site, log in and click on 'Odin Products'
   # then click on the 'Upload a new Odin product file' button. On the page that opens, click on 
   # the 'Browze' button to find and select the prods.zip file you just made. Select that file, 
   # then click 'Go'/ In a few seconds, the upload will have completed.

At this point, admins can examine the changes in the latest upload and can apply prices changes
where they have occurred (this is done simply by clearing the price field on the product and 
ticking the 'Apply' box. When the admin clicks submit, all the prices will be changed to meet the
new wholesale prices with an approprate margin, etc. They can also edit the description and the
Category and Subcategory for the product at the same time.
