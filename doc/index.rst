Welcome to the Vokomokum documentation!
========================================
This is the place where we collect useful information around our 
applications: What they do, what they contain and how to test and
develop them.

For starters, we just collect things we already have and it will hopefully 
grow into a coherent source of information.


******************
Order application
******************

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    order/app.rst

*******************
The database
******************

The database is shared between applications.
It runs on postgres.
We try to model many constraints on the database itself, also with procedures.

    
.. Indices and tables

.. * :ref:`genindex`
.. * :ref:`modindex`
.. * :ref:`search`
